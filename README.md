#*The Objectives*

1. This project is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. It aims to create the Eat-Da-Burger app which utilizes node, mysql and handlebars.

1. This will be coding for both the front and back-end and it was a challenge.  


## Final Notes

1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value. It will be more to highlight what I've learned so far.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this app better or if you notice some bugs.

1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me... and kindly explain to me as if I was a 12 year old :)

1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this  but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.
